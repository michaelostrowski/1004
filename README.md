# 1004
This is the basic 1004 form ready for back end development. This is the only known development version of this form available anywhere. This should have been FNMA's responsibility, which once again fell short of expectations. This was a very difficult form to code, I guess that's why they could only make it with a pdf. The only difference between the 1004 and the 1004p is the name and some basic text changes on the certification page. If you are building out an app use this form. Appraisers know this form and can adapt to your technology with this front end. Build out your desktop valuations with this form. www.deskappraisals.com to learn more.
