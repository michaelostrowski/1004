# 1004
This is the basic 1004 form ready for back end development. This is the only known development version of this form available. The only difference between the 1004 and the 1004p is the name and some basic text changes on the certification page. Appraisers know this form and can adapt to your technology with this front end.  www.deskappraisals.com to learn more.
